# Simulating Human Population Growth and Migration

Members: Karan Shah and Kartikeya Kumar

Our simulator can be used to simulate population behavior with respect to population growth and migration in a world consisting of different countries.

### Files in this branch:
* 0. Initial Project Proposal
* 1. Literature review, Conceptual Model and Implementation Plan
* 2. First implementation milestone. Implemented a distribution function to distribute resources and people, and initialized the world grid. Details in 3_3CSummary.pdf.
* 3. Second implementation milestone. Implemented population change and some migration functions. Calculating the migration destination is slow because we have to check the utility of each cell with respect to every other cell. Details in 4_3DSummary.pdf.
* 4. Final milestone. Implemented a recursive algorithm to calculate destinations. Details in 5_3ESummary.pdf. Ran the simulation. Results are in PrelimResult.pdf.

The final code is in Final_Project3.ipynb. The poster we made for the presentation is Final_Poster.pdf.
